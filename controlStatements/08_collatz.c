// (*) The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.
// The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations 
// will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.
// It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from
// the previous term as follows: if a term is even, the next term is one half of it.
// If a term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
// The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, 
// no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
// The conjecture has been shown to hold for all positive integers up to 2.95Ã—10^20, 
// but no general proof has been found.
